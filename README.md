## Roy Roger's Story

Here's the story of Roy Rogers. Roy is like every other Uroks : 
+ tiny
+ 3 tentacles arms
+ and a legs so tiny that you could barely distinguish them from his body.

One day, on the _203.5416.78_, he decided to take his spaceship and travel accross the universe.
- He landed on Earth 15 lightyears later. The date on Earth was 1944.

He could  change his  appearance and he did it, because for people in this time his form did be strange. When he met first people in Earth, he copied his appearance.
After he tried to speak with other, but it was a bad idea, because his first question was *Which year is now?*
People who listened this, thinkeds that he is strange and called hospital...
