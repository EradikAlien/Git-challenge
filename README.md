## Roy Roger's Story

Here's the story of Roy Rogers. Roy is like every other Uroks :

- tiny
- 3 tentacles arms
- and a legs so tiny that you could barely distinguish them from his body.

One day, on the _203.5416.78_, he decided to take his spaceship and travel accross the universe.

**Roy** quickly proved to be a formidable opponent for any _galactic pirate_ that crossed his path. He used his **small size** and quick thinking to outmaneuver and outsmart his enemies, striking fear into the hearts of those who tried to _plunder him_. ~~Despite the many dangers he faced,~~ **Roy** always managed to come out on top, earning a _reputation_ as a cunning and fearless **pirate urok** throughout the universe.

- He landed on Earth 15 lightyears later. The date on Earth was 1944
- He planned on giving valuable advanced technology information. Recources that are beyond actual intelectual cappabilities of the human breed.
- But Rogers witnessed world war2 and its attrocities. He decided that the human breed is not worthy so he fucked off.

He could change his appearance and he did it, because for people in this time his form did be strange. When he met first people in Earth, he copied his appearance. After he tried to speak with other, but it was a bad idea, because his first question was Which year is now? People who listened this, thinkeds that he is strange and called hospital.

***Roy*** quickly realized that his appearance and language were too different from the humans on Earth, and he needed to blend in if he wanted to avoid being discovered. He decided to disguise himself as a human and learn their ways, so he carefully observed the people around him and adapted his appearance and behavior accordingly.
