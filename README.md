## Roy Roger's Story

Here's the story of Roy Rogers. Roy is like every other Uroks :

- tiny
- 3 tentacles arms
- and his are legs so tiny that you could barely distinguish them from his body.

One day, on the _203.5416.78_, he decided to take his spaceship and travel accross the universe.

**Roy** quickly proved to be a formidable opponent for any _galactic pirate_ that crossed his path. He used his **small size** and quick thinking to outmaneuver and outsmart his enemies, striking fear into the hearts of those who tried to _plunder him_. ~~Despite the many dangers he faced,~~ **Roy** always managed to come out on top, earning a _reputation_ as a cunning and fearless **pirate urok** throughout the universe.

- He landed on Earth 15 lightyears later. The date on Earth was 1944
- He planned on giving valuable advanced technology information. Resources that are beyond actual intelectual capabilities of the human race.
- But Rogers witnessed world war2 and its attrocities. He decided that the human race is not worthy so he fucked off.

***Roy*** quickly realized that his appearance and language were too different from the humans on Earth, and he needed to blend in if he wanted to avoid being discovered. He decided to disguise himself as a human and learn their ways, so he carefully observed the people around him and adapted his appearance and behavior accordingly.

He could change his appearance and he did it, because for people of this time his form would be strange. When he first met people on Earth, he copied their appearance. After he tried to speak with them, but it was a bad idea, because his first question was what year is now? People who listened this, thought that he was strange and called hospital...
