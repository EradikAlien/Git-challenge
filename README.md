## Roy Roger's Story

Here's the story of Roy Rogers. Roy is like every other Uroks : 
+ tiny
+ 3 tentacles arms
+ and a legs so tiny that you could barely distinguish them from his body.

One day, on the _203.5416.78_, he decided to take his spaceship and travel accross the universe.
- He landed on Earth 15 lightyears later. The date on Earth was 1944
- He planned on giving valuable advanced technology information. Recources that are beyond actual intelectual cappabilities of the human breed.
- But Rogers witnessed world war2 and its attrocities. He decided that the human breed is not worthy so he fucked off.
